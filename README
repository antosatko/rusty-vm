# Rusty Danda binary

binary is not meant to be human readable
 - stack indexing starts at 1 (this is not a feature, it is just so minor bug i honestly dont care)
 - call: res - frz - set args - rret - ret
 - code ptr on call stack must always point to last location and should be treated as immutable
